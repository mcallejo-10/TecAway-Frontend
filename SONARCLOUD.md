# SonarCloud Integration for TecAway Frontend

## 🎯 Overview

This document describes the SonarCloud integration for code quality analysis, security scanning, and technical debt management.

## 📊 Current Code Quality Status

After running ESLint with SonarJS rules, we've identified:
- **210 issues** detected (204 errors, 6 warnings)
- **33 auto-fixable** issues
- **Main categories**:
  - Code Smells (duplicate strings, cognitive complexity)
  - Best Practices (strict equality, dependency injection)
  - Accessibility (keyboard events, focus management)
  - TypeScript (explicit types, unused variables)

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### 1. sonar-project.properties
Core configuration for SonarCloud analysis:
- Project identification
- Source and test paths
- Coverage report paths
- Quality gate settings

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflows
- `.github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml` - Basic SonarCloud analysis
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Complete CI/CD pipeline with quality gates

### 3. ESLint Configuration
- `eslint.config.js` - Enhanced with SonarJS rules for code quality

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: SonarCloud Account Setup
1. Go to [SonarCloud.io](https://sonarcloud.io)
2. Sign in with GitHub account
3. Import `mcallejo-10/TecAway-Frontend` repository
4. Get the `SONAR_TOKEN` from Account > Security

### Step 2: GitHub Secrets Configuration
Add these secrets to GitHub repository settings:
```
SONAR_TOKEN: [Your SonarCloud token]
```

### Step 3: Quality Gate Configuration
In SonarCloud project settings:
- **Coverage**: > 80% (we currently have 100% on services)
- **Duplicated Lines**: < 3%
- **Maintainability Rating**: A
- **Reliability Rating**: A
- **Security Rating**: A

## 📈 Quality Metrics to Track

### Code Coverage
- **Current Services Coverage**: 7/7 services at 100%
- **Target Overall Coverage**: > 80%
- **Critical Files**: All service files must maintain 100%

### Technical Debt
- **Code Smells**: Currently 210 issues identified
- **Duplicated Code**: Multiple string literals need constants
- **Cognitive Complexity**: Some functions exceed 15 complexity

### Security
- **Security Hotspots**: Monitor for potential vulnerabilities
- **Dependencies**: Track outdated/vulnerable packages

## 🔍 Analysis Categories

### 1. Bugs 🐛
- Logic errors that could cause runtime issues
- TypeScript type safety violations

### 2. Vulnerabilities 🔒
- Security issues in dependencies
- Potential injection points
- Authentication/authorization flaws

### 3. Code Smells 👃
- **Duplicated Strings**: Extract to constants
- **Cognitive Complexity**: Refactor complex functions
- **Dead Code**: Remove unused imports/variables

### 4. Coverage 📊
- Unit test coverage
- Integration test coverage
- E2E test coverage

## 🛠️ Local Development

### Run ESLint Analysis
```bash
npm run lint                    # Check all issues
npm run lint -- --fix         # Auto-fix 33+ issues
```

### Run Tests with Coverage
```bash
npm run test:jest:ci           # Generate coverage for SonarCloud
```

### Build Verification
```bash
npm run build                  # Ensure project builds successfully
```

## 📋 Quality Improvement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Auto-fixable)
- [x] Fix 33 auto-fixable ESLint issues
- [ ] Extract duplicate string literals to constants
- [ ] Remove unused imports and variables

### Phase 2: Code Quality (Manual fixes)
- [ ] Reduce cognitive complexity in identified functions
- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript types (remove `any`)
- [ ] Add accessibility improvements (keyboard events)

### Phase 3: Advanced Improvements
- [ ] Implement dependency injection migration
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Optimize performance bottlenecks
